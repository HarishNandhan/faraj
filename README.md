FACE RECOGNITION :
================
Face recognition is the technology used to identify or verify the identity of a person based on their facial features, such as the distance between the eyes, nose, and mouth, the shape of the jawline, and the overall structure of the face. The process involves capturing an image of a person's face, analyzing it using algorithms that extract facial features, and then comparing those features to a database of known faces to determine a match. Facial recognition technology has many practical applications, including security and surveillance, access control, law enforcement, and border control.

IMAGE ENHANCEMENT :
=================
Image enhancement is the process of improving the visual quality of a image by increasing its resolution, improving its color balance, and reducing noise and other distortions. The goal of image enhancement is to make the video more visually appealing, improve its clarity, and bring out details that might be difficult to see otherwise.

There are several techniques used for image enhancement, including:
Upscaling: This involves increasing the resolution of the image to make it appear sharper and more detailed.
Denoising: This involves removing noise from the image to make it clearer.
Color correction: This involves adjusting the color balance of the image to make it appear more natural and visually appealing.
Contrast adjustment: This involves adjusting the brightness and contrast of the image to make it appear more vivid and clearer.

LIP-SYNC using LIPNET :
=====================

Lip reading using AI involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze video footage of a person speaking and automatically transcribing the spoken words based on the movements of their lips and other facial features. This technology is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR) from visual speech, or lip-reading technology.
AI-powered lip reading technology works by training deep learning models on large datasets of videos that pair audio speech with visual speech movements. The models learn to associate specific mouth movements with particular speech sounds and then use this knowledge to generate transcriptions of spoken words based on the video input.
